    <h2>A story of Drama and Deceit<h/2>
      <p>There was once a penguine. He was waddle through Antarctica looking for his next meal. It had been 2 days since his last fish and he had lost his way.</p>

  <p>He had wandered far and wide, yet found himself wihout a fish. He thought <i>Maybe the polar bears ate all the fish</i>. He looked out into the distance and saw what looked like a wolf. <i>Oh shoot</i></p><img src="http://www.naturebob.com/zenphoto/cache/mammals/wolves-and-coyotes/black-wolf-and-mendenhall-glacier_595.jpg"style="width:40%">
  <p>The penguine decided to hide in a hole nearby</p><img src="http://i.livescience.com/images/i/000/016/583/i02/CIMG1111.JPG?1305170924"style="width:40%">
  <p>The dark figure approached the area that the penguin was hiding. He peeked over the top of the hole and saw what he thought was a wolf</p><img src=
  <p>The penguin realized it was only a dog and hopefully would not eat him, so he stepped out of his hole and said, <i>"What's up?"</i><br><br>
    <i>"Nothing. I'm out here exploring."</i><br><br>
    <i>"Do you have any food kind sir?"</i><br><br>
    <i>"I am a woman."</i><br><br>
    <i>"I'll trade you a fish for an egg."</i><br><br>
    <i>"I'm a man. I don't have eggs."</i><br><br>
    <i>"I know all about penguin culture. The male carries the egg."</i><br><br>
    <p>The penguin pulled his egg out from under his belly.</p><img src="http://www.natgeocreative.com/comp/MI/001/1246389.jpg"style="width:40%">
    <p>The penguin "accidently" dropped his egg. It fell towards some rocks nearby and he picked it back up. He handed the dog the egg. The dog said, "Thanks, here's a fish."</p><br>
    The penguin quickly ate the fish and started on his journey again<br>
    <i>I hope he doesn't notice</i>
    <br>
    Later on the dog began a fire and tried to roast the egg. Onve it was done cooking, he pulled it from <thead>
      he flames and tried to eat it. He realized it was a rock.
